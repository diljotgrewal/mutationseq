= mutationSeq_4.0.0 =
=====================

New in this version
-------------------
- It has been re-written from scratch in c++ layer using bamtools instead of samtools and completely refactored in the python layer. It is the most robust, most reliable version to date.

- Memory usage has tremendously been reduced and can in fact be confined to a certain level using option -b/--buffer_size.

- Models have also been retrained to get the most accurate results.

Downlaod and usage
------------------
The package is available to academics under the terms of the GPL3. 
Non-academic users should contact Dr. Patrick Rebstein at the BC Cancer Agency Technology Development Office for license agreements.

Installation
------------
Please see the "mutationSeq_user_manual.pdf" provided in the packege.

Known Issues
------------
- -b/--buffer_size option has a tolerance around the specified memory size. For instance, using "-b 4G" in the command line can result in memory usage of 3.6G or 4.2G. So, if you are submitting your jobs on cluster with very stringent limitations on the memory usage, please make sure to ask for more memory than you specify using -b/--buffer_size option.

- Occasionally, running mutationSeq on a region of positions using -i/--interval option can result in different probabilities than running mutationSeq using -f/--positions_file over a file with list of the same positions.
