mutationSeq-2 alpha
===================

This package will build the bam/fasta traversal engine.  This requires:

* Python 2.7 header files
* zlib headers

To extract and classify features using scikits-learn you will want to install:

* numpy
* scipy
* scikits-learn

I have exclusively used Python 2.7 for development and testing.

For this 'alpha' release note that:

* there is no install mechanism
* defining features is tedious and ugly


Installing
----------

python setup.py build

Copy the compiled pybam.so file from build/ to somewhere visible to the
mutationSeq script you want to run.  The path of this README is fine if you
would like to try out the included 'train.py' and 'classify.py' scripts


Example
-------

Using 'example.pos' as a template you can indentify known events in a
normal/tumour pair:

train.py normal.bam tumour.bam reference.fasta example.pos

This will yield a 'model.npz' in the working directory.

Using this model, another normal/tumour pair can be classified:

classify.py normal.bam tumour.bam reference.fasta

Which will read model.npz and classify a random chromosome for the given
pair.
